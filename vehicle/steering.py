# steering.py
"""Module containing PyBOID steering behavior functions.

Each type of behaviour needs a force_foo() function to compute the actual
steering force. The first argument ("owner") is the vehicle that is being
steered. Any number of additional arguments are permitted. This allows the
SteeringBehaviour.compute_force functions to automatically call each active
behaviour's force_foo() function with appropriate arguments.

Each behaviour also needs a activate_foo() function. The first argument
("steering") is an instance of SteeringBehaviour owned by the given vehicle;
additional arguments are intended to be stored within the SteeringBehaviour
instance and then passed to the corresponding force_foo() each update. See
the SEEK code for a simple example.

Importing this module will automatically generate a BEHAVIOUR_LIST containing
all behaviours that follow the conventions above. This makes it very easy to
add additional behaviours with minimal changes to the existing code (besides
writing the force/activate functions, SteeringBehaviour.PRIORITY_LIST would
need to be modified if using budgeted force).

TODO: SteeringBehavious.flocking is not automatically updated by pause, stop,
and resume methods. FIX THIS!

TODO: Future versions might provide a mechanism for importing only a subset
of the available behaviours, but this isn't really needed at this time.
